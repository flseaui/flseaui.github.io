                                        I was the lead programmer on Ocular, a 3D puzzle game about color and
                                        perspective. I worked with a designer, 3D artist, and musician to create
                                        a fun, pretty, and optimized cross-platform experience. I designed and wrote many complex
                                        systems and tools for the game, including a voxel animator, dynamic pathfinding system, and an in-game level editor which was used
                                        to build all 30+ levels in the game.

                                        Due to Covid and other factors collaboration became more difficult and development slowed,
                                        we cut features and eventually stopped. Though discouraging, we still hope to do a cleaned up Steam release at some point.

                                        I managed and lead a team of 20 high school students to write
                                        autonomous driving software for an RC car in under two months.
                                        I helped designate project roles and coordinate team members, set up and managed a large
                                        git repository and worked to streamline our collaboration and communication process.
                                        I provided guidance and direction to team members, helped set realistic goals and decide
                                        when features needed to be cut. I also designed and maintained the projects infrastructure
                                        and core systems with the help of a few others.
                                    </p>

                                        In 2018 we were invited to the AutoSens conferance in Belgium where we spoke on a panel about our project and experiences and
                                        had a booth and live demo during the day. We won 2 awards.

                                        Ironclad is a platform fighter I worked on for eight months with one other developer.
                                        Most of my time was spent working on rollback netcode and online lobbies (as we knew how
                                        much harder it could be to add later on) and a tool to let us visually design characters/moves,
                                        with the plan to eventually turn it into a player creation tool. Rollback requires complete determinism to function, and Unity
                                        isn't remotely deterministic, so solving that problem was very difficult and took far longer than we
                                        expected. We eventually finished an initial revision of the netcode but by that point it was clear
                                        that the scope of the project was far bigger than we could handle on our own so we put it on pause.

                                    <li> Had to ditch most Unity systems and used fixed-point math to keep determinism </li>

                                    <li>  At the time the genre was still niche but growing rapidly and we hoped to capitalize on that,
                                        we had many heavily desired features planned that didn't yet exist in competitors (but now do)

                                        SKF is a fighting game I developed with three friends in 2018. I was brought on
                                        after the game had already been in development for four months to help clean up and refactor
                                        a section of the project. What I expected to take just a few days ended up taking weeks 
                                        and by the time it was over I was too invested (and needed) to leave so I stayed as
                                        lead developer for the rest of the project. The game has three playable characters, five stages,
                                        tons of intricately designed and animated moves, and a 15 song soundtrack. We also had 
                                        3 more characters and AI opponents planned but we ran out of time to implement them before our deadline.

                                        I've participated in more than 20 game jams over the past 6+ years and learned many valuable lessons in project scope, design, prototyping/experimentation, etc.
                                        Working with the pressure and environment that game jams create isn't exactly my forte but I still love participating and learn a lot every time.
                                        Below is a collection of screenshots from some of my better games.

                        <p> 
                            I've been a creator for as long as I can remember, when I was young it was
                            drawings, stories, stop-motion animations, but for the past 10 or so years it has been games.
                            I've always been fascinated by games and have spent much of my life 
                            figuring out how they work and creating my own. I initially started by making small
                            Minecraft mods and loved getting to express myself through a medium I cared so much about, as I spent
                            more time focused on making games I realized how much I loved programming too, the problem solving, logic, collaboration,
                            there's nothing quite like it. I love the satisfaction of architecting the perfect solution to
                            a software problem and am always looking for a new challenge.
                            I have experience with many languages and frameworks and can quickly pick up new ones. I'm motivated
                            and driven by a desire to bring people joy and have fun doing it.
                        </p>
                        <P>
                            As motivated as I've been I felt unsupported by my environment for the longest time, I was unengaged with and 
                            uninterested in school (and was going through a very stressful time of gender discovery), and decided to stop attending in 2018
                            to fully persue indie game development, I quickly got a GED then started Broken Record Studios with a friend of mine.
                            Though our two games Ironclad and Ocular never saw the light of day I learned and improved so much and feel
                            fully prepared for whatever is next.
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            When not programming you can probably find me tinkering with various other creative projects, playing games,
                            rock climbing, or spending time with friends. 
                        </p>
